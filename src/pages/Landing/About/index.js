      <p>
        Back in 2021, I searched heavily for a career I would feel passionate
        about. I really enjoy creative thinking and solving complex problems so
        when I tried my hand at website development it was a perfect fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a dedicated Devmountain graduate with a deep-seated passion for the
        front-end I thrive in supporting my team members in achieving our shared
        professional goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main focus now is to continuously upgrade my skills and understanding
        of development. When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually reading,
        drawing, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds.
